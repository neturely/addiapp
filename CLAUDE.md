## What this project is

AddiApp is a gamified personal task app. Core loop: a mascot-led home screen
guides the user to one task at a time (rather than a full list), and
completing tasks earns points with bonuses for speed and daily volume. A
separate "dashboard" surface gives a clean admin view (add/edit/list tasks)
for anyone who wants manual control instead of the guided flow.

This is a **full rebuild, not a migration**. The original Next.js/Supabase
codebase is fully discarded — nothing carries forward except the general task
concept (title/completed/timestamp) and font assets. No data-loss concern;
the old app was never in real use.

**Status: Release 1 is LIVE at https://addiapp.com** (React SPA + PHP API + MySQL).

## My background

- Full-stack developer, 17+ years in IT (Java, Spring Boot, Node.js, React, PHP, Docker)
- Based in Linköping, Sweden
- AddiApp is a project under the Neturely umbrella (web hosting and development company)
- Domain `addiapp.com` registered/proxied via Cloudflare
- Hosting: KnownHost **Basic Plus Reseller** — the SAME cPanel/CloudLinux/LiteSpeed
  account as wptips.com (sister Neturely project), NOT a separate shared plan.
  This plan does **not** offer Node.js app hosting (no CloudLinux Node.js
  Selector), which is why the backend is PHP (see Decisions).
- Dev environment: macOS + colima (Docker) + VSCode + Claude Code.

## Decisions already made — do not re-litigate

- Frontend: React (Vite) SPA — not Next.js. Static build served from the docroot.
- Backend: **plain PHP 8.2 + PDO** (`api/`) — no framework, no Composer runtime
  deps. NOT Node/Express (the KnownHost plan can't run Node) and not Next.js. The
  original Node/Express/Drizzle `server/` was fully rewritten in PHP (#77); the
  HTTP contract was preserved, so the client was untouched.
- Database: MySQL/MariaDB — not Postgres, not Supabase.
- DB access: **plain PDO**, parameterized queries. Schema is hand-written SQL in
  `api/migrations/`, applied by `api/migrate.php` (tracked in a `_migrations`
  table). No ORM (the Drizzle era ended with the PHP rewrite). Migration
  discipline (#103): **one logical change (ideally one statement) per file** +
  idempotent DDL (`CREATE TABLE/INDEX IF NOT EXISTS`) so a re-run/partial-failure
  can't wedge — the per-file tracker + auto-committing DDL means a multi-statement
  file that dies mid-way is left partially applied. **Engine caveat (#184):** dev
  is MySQL 8.0 but prod is MariaDB 10.11 — `ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS` is
  **MariaDB-only** and errors on the dev DB. For a **single-statement** ALTER, use
  plain `ADD COLUMN` (no `IF NOT EXISTS`): the tracker runs it exactly once and one
  statement can't leave a partial state. `CREATE TABLE/INDEX IF NOT EXISTS` is fine
  (both engines support it).
- Auth: custom, self-rolled — **DB-backed server-side sessions** (opaque random
  token in an httpOnly `sid` cookie, 7-day TTL; the `sessions` row is the source
  of truth, so logout/expiry revoke access immediately) + **bcrypt** via PHP's
  `password_hash`/`password_verify`. Sessions, **not JWT**. Not Supabase Auth.
- Styling: Tailwind CSS v4 (utility classes, no config file; coral brand accents
  as arbitrary values like `bg-[#D85A30]`).
- Transactional email: **Resend** (direct curl from PHP; `RESEND_API_KEY`) for
  verification + password-reset. Deliberately NOT Brevo: wptips.com uses Brevo for
  its marketing/contacts/automation layer, which AddiApp doesn't need — AddiApp is
  pure transactional, exactly Resend's niche. Two intentional per-project choices,
  not an inconsistency. Production email is **live** — `addiapp.com` verified in
  Resend, sending from `no-reply@addiapp.com` (#61/#62/#65).
- Hosting: KnownHost Basic Plus Reseller — cPanel/CloudLinux/LiteSpeed. LiteSpeed
  serves the PHP backend directly (no process/Passenger to restart). **SSH is
  available.**
- Domain: `addiapp.com`, live, proxied through Cloudflare.
- GitHub: org `neturely`, repo `addiapp`.
- Deploy: **done (#39)** — GitHub Actions on push to `main` builds the SPA and
  rsyncs it (+ the PHP `api/`) over SSH. Ordering is **migrate-before-cutover**
  (#103): ship the ops script + migrations, run a **pre-deploy DB backup that
  gates the migrate** (`backup-db.sh --pre-deploy && migrate.php`), THEN rsync
  code + SPA — so a failed backup/migrate aborts before new code goes live. No
  restart. See docs/DEPLOY.md.
- Secrets: production config in `~/api/config.php` (a PHP array **outside** the
  web root, `chmod 600`, git-ignored, rsync-excluded) — NOT a `.env` (a PHP file
  isn't served as plaintext even if exposed; `.env` is).
- Old codebase/live site: fully disposable, no migration effort required.
- Design mood: bold, colorful, mascot-driven (Duolingo-style personality, not
  literal look) layered on Todoist/Linear-level clean UI chrome. Trello's
  structural idea (liked conceptually) is NOT literally adopted — home flow is
  single-task-at-a-time, not a board.
- Points visibility: shown up front (approximate) before task commitment —
  not hidden until completion. Deliberate: visibility is motivating.
- Release strategy: minimal Release 1 (now live), defer competitive/social
  features (leaderboards, teams, projects, sharing) to later phases.

## Points / gamification system (finalized, #28)

All numbers are FINAL and live in ONE file — `api/src/Points/PointsConfig.php`.
Tuning them never touches the pure math (`Points/Calculate.php`) or the award
orchestration (`Points/Award.php`). See PROJECT_SPEC §7 for the full formulas.

- Base points: Low = 2, Medium = 5, High = 10.
- Estimated time: entered manually at creation (minutes); not derived from complexity.
- Speed bonus (saturation-based, anti-gaming): scales with time saved, reaching
  the ceiling of **+100% of base** (`SPEED_BONUS_MAX_RATIO = 1.0`) at
  **≤50% of the estimate** (`SPEED_BONUS_SATURATION = 0.5`); 0 if on/over estimate.
- Daily multiplier: `min(1 + (n−1)·0.15, 2.0)` for the n-th completion of the day
  (`GROWTH = 0.15`, `CAP = 2.0`) → cap at the **8th** task/day; resets at midnight
  in `APP_TIMEZONE` (default **Europe/Stockholm**). Total = `round((base + speed) × mult)`.
- Idempotency: points awarded **once per task, ever** — enforced by a
  `UNIQUE(task_id)` on `points_log` plus a duplicate-key catch, so even a
  concurrent double-complete awards once (#74).
- Points are shown up front (approximate base, before commitment) — decided.

## Task-selection algorithm (Play mode, #31)

Behind a swappable seam in `api/src/Tasks/Selection.php`. The route
(`GET /api/tasks/next`) filters candidates (win-type → complexity: small =
{low, medium}, big = {medium, high}; time-available; backlog only; optional
`exclude` for re-roll); the strategy only picks one — no selection logic in the
controller.

- Default: **`weightedByAge`** — weighted random favouring older tasks
  (rank-based weights; oldest most likely, still random). Alternates
  `oldestFirst` / `uniformRandom` ship too.
- A future **per-user selection preference** is designed for (swap
  `Selection::strategies()[$name]`) but **not built** — no settings page yet.

## What's built (maps to PROJECT_SPEC §5/§6) — LIVE at addiapp.com

Backend endpoints (PHP, `api/src/Controllers/`); the client contract is identical
to the old Node API.

- **Auth (#26, #61, #62, #67, #79, #80)**: `/api/auth/{register,login,logout,me,verify,
  resend-verification,forgot-password,reset-password}`. DB-backed sessions, bcrypt.
  Email verification gates login; password reset revokes all sessions. register
  survives email-send failures (best-effort, #67) and is **non-enumerating** —
  an existing email gets the same 201 + neutral body as a new one, no insert, no
  re-sent email (#118); login/forgot/resend are neutral too. login/register + the
  email endpoints are rate-limited (#80). **Cloudflare Turnstile CAPTCHA** on register +
  forgot-password, verified server-side via `siteverify` (#79) — all-or-nothing on
  `turnstileSecret` (`config.php`) + `TURNSTILE_SITE_KEY` (build env); unset =
  disabled (dev default, fails closed if only the secret is set). Client pages:
  `/verify`, `/forgot-password`, `/reset`.
- **Task CRUD (#27, #184)**: user-scoped `GET/POST/PATCH/DELETE /api/tasks` + `GET /api/tasks/next`.
  Tasks have an optional plain-text **`description`** (#184, `varchar(1000)` NULL, empty→NULL,
  line breaks kept via `whitespace-pre-wrap`): a textarea in the shared `TaskForm`, shown on the
  TaskPresented card, and an **expandable chevron row** on the dashboard table (chevron only when a
  description exists — a sibling button beside the click-to-edit title, expanding a colSpan `<tr>`).
- **Points (#28)**: `GET /api/points` (card) and `GET /api/points/stats` (lifetime + streak).
- **Play mode (#29–#34, #69, #191)**: Choice `/play` is the landing (`/` redirects
  to it — the standalone Home screen was retired in #191), Task `/play/task`,
  In-progress `/play/progress/:id`, Completion, Empty state. A mid-flight task is
  surfaced by a Resume banner on Choice **plus** the header timer chip.
- **Dashboard (#36, #178)**: `/dashboard` — table + inline edit, full edit page
  `/tasks/:id/edit` (shared `TaskForm`), status filter tabs, sortable columns,
  per-row icon actions (Start/Resume=Play, Edit=Pencil, Delete=Trash; Save=Check
  / Cancel=X while editing — all `aria-label`led), undo-toast delete. **The
  `backlog` status DISPLAYS as "To do"** (filter tab, status badge, edit select) —
  presentation-only; the enum value stays `backlog`, so never string-match the
  label. Rows are a fixed `h-14` so inline-edit doesn't change row height.
- **Add task (#35)**: `/tasks/new`. **Points card (#37)**. **Stats page (#38)**: `/stats`.
- **Deploy (#39)** + **production email (#65)** done.

NOT yet built: marketing homepage (#40, unscoped), user guide (#41, unscoped).
Auth hardening beyond rate-limiting (CAPTCHA/edge) is #79.

## Local dev environment

- Docker Compose (macOS + colima) — a **MySQL 8.0 container only**; the app runs
  on the host. Requires PHP 8.2+ on the host.
- First-time setup:
  1. `cp .env.example .env` (docker MySQL creds)
  2. `npm install`
  3. `npm run db:up` — MySQL 8.0 on `localhost:3306` (data in the `db_data` volume)
  4. `npm run db:migrate` — runs `php api/migrate.php`
  5. `npm run dev` — client on http://localhost:5173, PHP API on
     http://127.0.0.1:3001 (Vite proxies `/api`)
- No local `api/config.php` is needed — the built-in defaults point at the docker
  MySQL. With no `RESEND_API_KEY`, emails use the console transport (links logged
  to the API output).
- Changing the schema: add a numbered `.sql` to `api/migrations/`, then
  `npm run db:migrate`. Reset with `npm run db:reset`.
- **macOS + colima gotcha:** if `docker` reports "command not found" though colima
  is installed, the Homebrew `docker` CLI isn't linked. Fix once:
  `ln -sf "$(brew --prefix docker)/bin/docker" /opt/homebrew/bin/docker` then `colima start`.

## Screens (built)

All Play-mode and dashboard screens are implemented and live (#29–#38, #69). The
only screens not built are the marketing/landing homepage (#40) and user
guide/help content (#41) — both unscoped.

App shell (#92): authenticated routes render inside `AppLayout` (Header → Outlet
→ Footer). The Header nav is intentionally **Play + Dashboard only** — the
initials **avatar is the Stats link** (avatar-as-Stats is a deliberate #92
decision, not a missing nav item), and logout lives in the Footer. Add-task is a
Header CTA button. A live **in-progress timer chip** (#135) sits left of the Play
icon when a task is in progress — `InProgressProvider` (wrapping `AppLayout`)
tracks the most-recently-started in-progress task (fetch on mount + route change,
no polling); `TimerChip` ticks client-side off `startedAt` and links to
`/play/progress/:id`.

Shared **`CardScreen`** (`components/CardScreen.tsx`, #181/#183): the centered
flat white rounded card used for celebratory/confirmation screens — Completion
and the Play-mode empty state both render through it (`decoration` slot holds
accents that spill past the card, e.g. Completion's corner confetti). Reach for
it for new full-screen card moments rather than re-rolling the shell. Responsive
note: the app's only breakpoint is **`sm`** (640px) — there is no `md`/`lg` in
use; the Choice screen flanks the mascot side-by-side at `sm+` and stacks it
above the two win cards below `sm`.

Mascot: icon-style, expression-driven SVG (#96) — one `Mascot` component
(`client/src/components/Mascot.tsx`) with an `expression` prop (`neutral |
celebrating | idle`); a penguin-ish icon (golden-yellow head + darker orange-gold
crest, pale-cream eye patches, orange-red beak) whose FACE carries emotion while
the body colour stays constant — deliberately distinct from both the UI palette
and Duolingo's green. Colours are dedicated `--color-mascot-*` tokens in
`index.css`. This is
the SVG icon-system pass, NOT final illustrated art — real mascot art is still a
deliberate later design pass, likely in Claude Design.

Color palette — **vivid v3** (#143; single source `client/src/index.css`, flat,
no shadows/borders, AA-verified). Each hue has THREE roles — never one token doing
double duty:
- `--color-{h}` = **vivid FILL** (`bg-{h}`): primary `#FB5231`, success `#1F9E3E`,
  accent `#1CB0F6`, warning `#C17F00`. (success deepened from `#3ECF4C` in #174,
  warning from `#FFC800` in #176 — both so large/bold white text clears 3:1 on the
  fill, like primary's `#FF5A36`→`#FB5231` tune. `accent` is NOT tuned — it still
  fails white, stays dark-on-fill only. Solid-fill uses: the dashboard banner, the
  AddTask effort picker, and the InProgress meter bars.)
- `--color-{h}-ink` = **text on LIGHT** (`text-{h}-ink`, colored text/badges on
  cream/white): primary `#C43A0C`, success `#0B7C63`, accent `#6E3FD6`, warning
  `#8A5A00`. (These are the old v2 values — they were already AA as text.)
- `--color-on-{h}` = **dark text ON the fill** (`text-on-{h}`): primary `#3D1200`,
  success `#04240B` (deepened #174), warning `#2E2000` (deepened #176) — the last two
  deepened alongside their fills so the small on-fill caption/label still clears 4.5:1.
- `--color-{h}-tint` = soft tint for low-emphasis badges (`bg-{h}-tint` + `text-{h}-ink`).

Plus `muted #5B6270`, cream `page #F6F1EA`, `surface #FFFFFF`, and the `--color-mascot-*`
set (separate). Old coral `#D85A30` fully retired; the v2 muted fills are gone as fills.

**Text-on-vivid rule (do not violate):** dark on-fill text (`text-on-{h}`) by default;
**white is allowed on the TUNED fills — `--color-primary`, `--color-success`,
`--color-warning` — only for large/bold text** (≥24px, or ≥19px bold — WCAG's 3:1
large-text tier; white on `#FB5231` = 3.31, on `#1F9E3E` = 3.49, on `#C17F00` = 3.33).
Those three fills were deepened (#143/#174/#176) specifically so white clears 3:1;
**`--color-accent` was NOT tuned — never put white on accent.** Applied to: the
PointsCard/Stats large stat numbers, the dashboard banner (#174), the AddTask effort-tile
labels (#176, `text-xl` bold), AND **all primary CTA buttons** — standardized to `text-xl`
(20px) `font-bold text-white` so they legitimately clear 3:1 (energetic look; dark-on-primary
read muddy). This includes the compact utility buttons — Header "Add task" and Dashboard
inline "Save" ARE primary CTAs and follow the same standardization. Everything else stays
dark on-fill: small labels/captions, badges, the filter/time pills, and the initials avatar
(small on-fill text needs 4.5:1, which is why `text-on-{h}` was deepened for the tuned hues).
Emphasis tiers: solid vivid + on-fill = high; tint + ink = low.

## Coding standards

- **Client**: TypeScript, React functional components + hooks (no classes).
  **All** API calls go through the single `apiRequest` wrapper (`client/src/lib/api.ts`)
  — `tasks.ts`/`points.ts` delegate to it, so every call throws a status-preserving
  `ApiError` (#101). No raw `fetch` in feature code. `apiRequest` also handles session
  expiry globally: a 401 on any non-`/auth/*` path fires `notifyUnauthorized()`
  (`lib/authSignal.ts`) → `AuthProvider` clears the user and `ProtectedRoute` redirects
  to `/login` with a muted note. `/auth/*` 401s stay local form errors (opt out elsewhere
  with `skipUnauthorizedHandler`).
- **Toasts (#176)**: app-wide transient notices go through the `ToastProvider` (`client/src/toast/`,
  mounted once in `AppLayout`) via `useToast().showToast({ message, icon, tone, action, duration })`.
  One toast at a time, colored icon badge (tone → badge fill), optional inline action, auto-dismiss
  (pauses on hover/focus), `role="status"`. It lives above the routes so a toast survives the
  navigation that raised it (e.g. AddTask fires one, then returns to the origin route). Prefer it
  over a bespoke per-page toast. The Dashboard undo-delete toast predates it and stays bespoke for
  now (its deferred-commit/undo semantics are page-specific) — a candidate for later migration.
- **Accessibility conventions (#126)**: standalone error messages use `role="alert"`;
  loading indicators and the undo toast use `role="status"` (toast also
  `aria-live="polite"` + `aria-atomic`, and pauses its auto-dismiss on hover/focus).
  Route changes move focus to `#main-content` via `RouteFocus` in `AppLayout` (which
  also hosts the skip link); an in-place screen (e.g. `Completion`) focuses its own
  heading. Segmented pill pickers use the `radiogroup` pattern (roving tabindex + arrow
  keys + `aria-checked`); icon/text-only controls get `aria-label`s. **No native
  `title=` tooltips** (removed sitewide in #181 — they render an ugly OS box for mouse
  users and duplicate the `aria-label`); label with `aria-label` only. Any CSS motion
  accent (e.g. the timer chip's `animate-pulse-dot`, the Completion confetti) must be
  disabled under `prefers-reduced-motion` in `index.css`. Don't add ARIA
  without verifying the SR/keyboard interaction it produces — use the
  `client/e2e/` harness (`npm run e2e:a11y -w client`, #170): puppeteer-core drives
  the real app in system Chrome and asserts focus/keyboard/ARIA behavior. It's the
  in-repo tool for live-verifying any client interaction; needs the dev stack up
  (not in CI). See `client/e2e/README.md`.
- **Backend (PHP 8.2)**: plain PHP + PDO, no framework, no Composer runtime deps.
  Thin controllers; logic in modules (`Points/`, `Tasks/Selection.php`, `Auth/`).
  PDO **parameterized** queries only — never string-concatenate SQL. PSR-4-ish
  autoloader (`App\` → `api/src/`). Input validated server-side; the server is
  authoritative (the client mirrors rules for UX). Log via `App\Log`
  (`error`/`warn`/`info`, #122) — one structured JSON line to `error_log` with
  request context; don't add ad-hoc `error_log('[addiapp-…] …')` strings. (The
  dev `ConsoleTransport` email dump is not error logging and stays raw.)
- Secrets: production `api/config.php` (PHP array, outside the web root, `600`,
  git-ignored). Never a committed/web-served `.env`.
- Security headers (#107): set at the **origin, in-repo** (not Cloudflare) on both
  surfaces — SPA in `client/public/.htaccess` (top-level `Header always set`), API
  via early `header()` in `api/public/index.php` (before the OPTIONS short-circuit).
  HSTS/nosniff/XFO/`frame-ancestors 'none'`/Referrer-Policy. Don't move these to the
  edge (origin defense-in-depth is the point); don't add a content CSP (`script-src`)
  without a dedicated nonce/hash pass.

## Deployment (done — #39)

- GitHub Actions (`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`) on push to `main`: build the
  SPA, `rsync --delete` `client/dist` → `public_html` and `api/` → `~/api`
  (keeping `config.php`, `.well-known`, `cgi-bin`, the `api` symlink), then
  `ssh … php ~/api/migrate.php`. **No process to restart** (PHP).
- Routing: `public_html/api` is a **symlink** to `~/api/public`, so
  `addiapp.com/api/*` hits the PHP front controller; the SPA `.htaccess` handles
  client-side routing and skips `/api`.
- Secrets on the server: `~/api/config.php` (DB creds, `RESEND_API_KEY`, `appUrl`,
  `emailFrom`, `isProd`). GitHub secrets: `DEPLOY_SSH_{HOST,USER,PORT,KEY}`.
- **DB backups (OPS-1)**: nightly `mysqldump` cron (`scripts/backup-db.sh`) →
  gzipped/timestamped dumps in `~/backups/db/`, ~14-day rotation, read-only
  `addiapp_bak` user. App-level — JetBackup doesn't expose DB restore points on
  this account. `~/backups/db/` is the handoff for an external NAS pull (separate
  repo; not built here). Cron install is a documented on-box step, not deployed.
- Full details + one-time server setup + backups: **docs/DEPLOY.md**.

## How to help me

- Assume strong technical knowledge — skip basic explanations unless asked
- Ask, don't assume — if intent/architecture/requirements are unclear, ask
  before writing code
- Lead with the most practical solution first; call out KnownHost cPanel/PHP/
  LiteSpeed constraints when relevant
- Actively suggest better/longer-lasting solutions, but match complexity to the
  problem — this is a personal project, don't over-engineer
- Keep responses focused

## Never do these things

- Never suggest Node.js/Express/Next.js or any server that needs a persistent
  Node process — this plan runs PHP under LiteSpeed only.
- Never suggest Postgres or Supabase — MySQL/MariaDB only, self-hosted auth.
- Never suggest Auth.js/NextAuth — custom auth only.
- Never switch auth to JWT or a client-stored token — DB-backed sessions (opaque
  httpOnly `sid` cookie) by decision, so logout/expiry revoke immediately.
- Never suggest hiding points until task completion — decided to show them up front.
- Never "fix" AddiApp to use Brevo for consistency with wptips.com — AddiApp uses
  Resend by deliberate choice; different providers for different needs.
- **Never reference wptips.com's private editorial identity (the "Elise Porter" /
  `elise@` persona) anywhere in AddiApp** — separate projects, no shared identity.
  (It leaked once into a prod email `From`; scrubbed. Don't copy it from wptips
  context.)
- Never put production secrets in a committed or web-served `.env` — use
  `api/config.php` (PHP array, outside the web root, `600`).
- Never inline task-selection logic into the controller — it lives behind
  `api/src/Tasks/Selection.php` so a per-user preference stays a one-line swap.
- Never hardcode points numbers outside `api/src/Points/PointsConfig.php` — the
  single source; the client reads base points from `GET /api/points`.
- Never reintroduce the old Next.js/Supabase codebase without an explicit decision.

- [x] Hosting — **same KnownHost Basic Plus Reseller box as wptips** (not a separate plan)
- [x] SSH availability — **yes**; deploy is Actions + rsync + SSH migrate (#39)
- [x] Production email readiness — **domain verified, live** (#65)
- [x] Auth model — DB-backed sessions + bcrypt (not JWT)
- [x] Points formulas + task-selection algorithm — finalized
- [x] Play/dashboard designs — built
- [x] Monorepo (client workspace) — kept
- [x] Home screen — **retired (#191)**; `/` redirects to Choice as the single Play

  + resume-from-home decisions
